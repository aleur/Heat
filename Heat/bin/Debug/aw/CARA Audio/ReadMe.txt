If you wish to use a different .wav sound effect for cleaning just rename Cleaning.wav to something different and then which ever version you would like to use rename to Cleaning.wav 
(This is case sensitive so make sure its Cleaning.wav and not cleaning.wav)
Thank you Peter Badoingy for finding and creating the wax.wav's!!
Thank you wvssuptokyo for finding and creating the Default Cleaning.wav sound!!
